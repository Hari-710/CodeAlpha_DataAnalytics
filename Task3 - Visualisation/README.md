📊 CodeAlpha Internship – Task 3: Data Visualization
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of my CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship (Week 3).
The goal of this task was to take the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) results and present them visually to extract insights and tell a story from the dataset.

Dataset used: BooksToScrape (web-scraped dataset from Task 1).

🎯 Objectives

Perform visual analysis on book data.

Detect patterns, outliers, and relationships.

Present results using different visualization techniques.

Focus on storytelling through data rather than just raw plots.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas → data manipulation

Matplotlib → static visualizations

Seaborn → statistical plots

📈 Visualizations
🔹 1. Price Analysis

Distribution of Book Prices (Histogram)

Outlier Detection in Book Prices (Boxplot)

Top 10 Most Expensive Books (Bar Chart)

🔹 2. Rating Analysis

Rating Counts (Bar Chart)

Book Prices by Rating (Boxplot)

Average Price by Rating (Bar Chart)

🔹 3. Availability Analysis

Book Availability: In stock vs Out of stock (Bar Chart)

💡 Key Insights

Most books fall in the £20–£40 range, with some expensive outliers.

Higher-rated books are not always more expensive.

Availability is skewed towards in-stock books, but out-of-stock items highlight rarity.

📌 Conclusion

This task helped me understand the importance of visual storytelling in Data Analytics.
Raw numbers are useful, but visuals make insights easier to communicate and drive decisions.
